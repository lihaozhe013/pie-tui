# Architecture

`pie-tui` is a host shell. It never embeds or reimplements the agent: the whole
conversation, tool execution, session storage, and provider access live in the
`pi` binary. This document describes the boundary, the modules, and the rules the
code must keep to stay a thin client.

Rules that keep the client thin:

- No TypeScript or Node.js dependency. `go.mod` only lists Go modules.
- `pi` is discovered with `exec.LookPath` (`--pi` or `PI_TUI_PI` override).
- stdout is protocol only. Anything the UI needs to log goes to a file (`--debug`)
  or to the child's stderr tail kept for crash reports.
- The client keeps a *projection* of the session, never the source of truth. Every
  authoritative value comes from a response or a `message_end`/`*_end` event.

## Protocol rules

These are the invariants that make the client survive a pi upgrade.

| Rule | Where |
|---|---|
| Split records on LF only; `U+2028`/`U+2029` are legal inside strings | `rpc.readLine` |
| Never use `bufio.Scanner`: it caps a record at 64 KiB | `rpc.readLine` |
| Records above 32 MiB are dropped and the stream resynchronises | `rpc.readLine` |
| Unknown record types degrade to `UnknownEvent`, never to an error | `rpc.ParseLine` |
| Known records with unexpected payloads also degrade to `UnknownEvent` | `rpc.decodeEvent` |
| Responses are correlated by `id`; order is irrelevant | `Client.handleLine` |
| `prompt` success only means "accepted"; `data.disposition` explains how | `ui.applyResponse` |
| A run is over at `agent_settled`, not at `agent_end` | `ui.handleEvent` |
| `*_delta` is for live display; `text_end`/`message_end` are authoritative | `rpc.StreamAccumulator` |
| stderr is diagnostics, never protocol | `Client.readLoop` |
| Closing stdin requests shutdown; SIGTERM and SIGKILL are the escalation | `Client.Close` |

## Modules

### `internal/rpc`

- `events.go` — inbound record types, the permissive parser, and the streaming
  accumulator used to rebuild an assistant message from deltas.
- `client.go` — child process, pipes, correlation, backpressure, shutdown. One
  goroutine reads stdout and owns `cmd.Wait`; commands are written under a mutex;
  the event channel is bounded so the UI always sees backpressure rather than
  losing records.
- `commands.go` — typed builders for every documented command plus the response
  payload shapes the UI consumes.

The reader never renders. A slow consumer blocks the channel, which applies
backpressure to pi through the pipe instead of growing memory.

### `internal/session`

Read-only scanning of pi's session directory (`~/.pi/agent/sessions` by default,
`--session-dir`/`PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` override). It reads the header of
each `.jsonl` file for the ID and working directory, and finds the newest
`session_info` name by reading the file backwards in chunks. A fixed tail probe
would miss a title written early in a session and later pushed megabytes from
the end by a long conversation. Broken files are skipped so one bad file cannot
break the resume picker.

### `internal/ui`

- `model.go` — the Bubble Tea model: state, message dispatch, layout, and the
  frame composition. The frame is exactly `height` lines; any mismatch would
  scroll the alternate screen and hide the header.
- `update.go` — protocol events to UI state, key routing, slash commands, and the
  command helpers that call pi.
- `commands.go` — the client-side command table: canonical names, aliases, and
  the alias-to-command index shared by dispatch and completion.
- `palette.go` — the `ctrl+p` command launcher: client and pi commands ranked
  into the picker, run through the composer's dispatcher without touching the
  draft.
- `activity.go` — the live run status above the composer: phase, running tools,
  retry and compaction labels, the elapsed clock, the token estimate and t/s
  rate of the block being written, and the pulsing marker.
- `viewport.go` — transcript blocks, scrolling, incremental markdown, and the
  rendered-content cache used by mouse selection.
- `selection.go` — cell-accurate text selection over the rendered transcript:
  viewport-to-content coordinates, reverse-video highlighting, and plain-text
  extraction for the clipboard.
- `clipboard.go` — OSC52 plus platform clipboard commands, run asynchronously
  so a slow clipboard tool cannot stall the event loop.
- `input.go` — the prompt editor and slash completion. The editor is written
  directly against the buffer instead of nesting `bubbles/textarea`: the
  widget paints a full-line cursor background, moves across logical lines and
  hides its own scrollbar, none of which fit a soft-wrapped composer. The
  custom editor owns wrapping, the caret cell, the sticky column for vertical
  movement, and the scroll offset, so the box height and the visible rows
  always agree.
- `overlay.go` — pickers and extension dialogs.
- `diff.go` — tool argument/result extraction and a dependency-free line diff.
- `styles.go` — the Lip Gloss palette and the glamour style derived from it.
- `view.go` — small formatting helpers.

### Automatic titles

An unnamed session is named automatically after its first settled turn, and
again when an unnamed session is resumed or attached. The request is a one-shot
`pi --print` subprocess with no tools or session state, and the result is written
back through `set_session_name`, so Pie and the TUI see the same title. Only one
request is allowed to write at a time, and a session switch or manual rename
invalidates an in-flight result before it can rename the wrong session or
overwrite a user's name. `/title` remains the explicit regenerate action.

### Selection

Mouse selection works on the rendered transcript, not on the markdown source.
The transcript caches its rendered lines and maps a mouse cell to a
`(line, column)` point, so scrolling and re-rendering keep the highlight anchored
to the text. Highlighting and copying walk grapheme clusters with `x/ansi`, which
keeps wide characters, emoji, and existing SGR colors intact. Copying strips ANSI
sequences, trims trailing spaces per line, and preserves blank lines inside the
selection.

Mouse capture is on by default. `shift+drag` is left to the terminal for native
selection, and `/mouse` toggles capture at runtime; `--no-mouse` starts with
capture off. Copying uses OSC52 for terminals and SSH sessions plus a platform
command (`pbcopy`, `wl-copy`, `xclip`, `xsel`, or `clip`) for terminals without
OSC52 support.

### Rendering budget

Streaming assistant text is split at blank lines outside fenced code blocks.
Everything before the tail is a *stable segment*: it is rendered once per width
and cached on the block. Only the tail is re-rendered, and only on a 40 ms tick,
so a fast token stream cannot saturate the CPU. An unterminated fence gets a
synthetic closing marker so code does not flicker between paragraph and block
styling.

## Configuration and the bridge

`pie-tui` and Pie share every file in pi's agent directory
(`PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, default `~/.pi/agent`):

- `settings.json`, `models.json`, `auth.json`, `mcp.json`, and `AGENTS.md` are
  pi's own files.
- `pie-model-settings.json`, `pie-tool-presets.json`, and the session log's
  `pie:tool-selection` / `pie:work-mode` entries are Pie's files; the TUI reads
  and writes the same shapes.
- `pie-tui-settings.json` holds terminal-only choices: theme, thinking-block
  visibility, tool expansion, the last working directory, and the last preset
  to seed a new session.

`internal/config` owns this layer. Documents keep object member order, JSONC
comments and trailing commas are accepted, writes are private (0600), atomic,
and serialized with a lock file beside the target, and a file that cannot be
parsed is backed up (`.corrupt-<timestamp>`) instead of being silently replaced.

`pi --mode rpc` does not expose tool switching, reload, or a system-prompt
read, so the binary embeds a small extension (`internal/bridge/pie-bridge.ts`),
writes it to `<state-dir>/bridge/`, and passes it with `-e`. The extension
registers `/pie-tools`, `/pie-mode`, `/pie-reload`, and `/pie-publish`; the UI
drives them with ordinary `prompt` commands. Tool selections and work modes are
written as the same session entries Pie uses, so a session moved between the
clients keeps its preset and its Plan mode. If the extension fails to load, the
UI reports `unavailable` in Settings › General and refuses preset changes
rather than silently diverging.

`pi --mode rpc` does not persist the model or thinking level it changes, so
`pie-tui` writes them itself: picking a model updates `defaultProvider` and
`defaultModel`, and a thinking-level change updates the current model's
`modelThinkingLevels` entry. pi then starts the next session on that model and
level, while a resumed session restores the pair recorded in its own log. The
save happens after the command succeeds, and an unreadable `settings.json` is
left alone with the error shown instead of being replaced.

`/fork` and `/clone` are RPC operations that replace the active session: after
the command the client refetches `get_messages`, state, stats, and entries, so
the transcript and header belong to the new session. A fork puts the chosen
prompt back in the editor, which is what the web UI does. `/tree` is read-only:
`get_tree` is printed into the transcript because the RPC has no command to make
an arbitrary node active; forking remains the way to branch. Enter-to-send is a
terminal-only preference because alt+enter is the only portable send chord when
Enter inserts newlines.

`/search` reads session files directly, newest first: a name or directory
match is checked before reading the body, and the transcript scan unmarshals
each matching line and walks its string values so the snippet reads as text.
The scan is capped per file so a huge session cannot stall the picker; the
result resumes the session through the existing `switch_session` path.

`/context` is fed by `/pie-publish`, not by the UI guessing: the bridge reads
`getActiveTools`, `getAllTools`, `getSystemPrompt`, and the session's work mode,
and marks each tool active at publish time. The panel lists the tools, offers
the system prompt through `$PAGER`, and refreshes on demand. A leadership
without the bridge shows why instead of an empty list. Tool presets and Plan
mode refuse with the reason as well: the binary always embeds the bridge, and
restarting without it would drop the current session instead of switching the
tool set in place.

`/stats` is a small settings-style panel over the `get_session_stats` payload.
It refreshes when the agent settles and when Refresh is pressed, and it shows
the same numbers as the status bar so the two cannot disagree.

Images are attachments on the normal prompt path, not a separate tool:
`/image` reads one local file, checks the MIME type, caps it at 20 MB, and
sends `prompt` with an `images` array. A turn must be idle first, because the
RPC follow-up command cannot carry images. The transcript shows a text
placeholder, matching how the web composer labels an attachment.

The working directory is the child process's `Dir`, fixed for the life of one
pi process. `/cwd` therefore restarts the child: it closes the old stdin,
starts a fresh pi with the same binary, flags, and bridge extension but no
`--session`, and re-runs the handshake. The new session starts in the chosen
folder; the old transcript is not carried over. A stale `closed` event from the
replaced child is ignored by comparing the client identity. Recent projects are
derived from the `cwd` in session headers rather than a second index, and
`pie-tui-settings.json` keeps the last choice only to seed the browser; the
process's own directory stays the default when no `--cwd` is given.

MCP servers are read from the agent's `mcp.json` and the project's
`.pi/mcp.json` with the same `mcpServers` shape pi uses. The panel edits only
three fields through `internal/config`: `enabled`, `exposure`, and removal; an
add goes through `pi mcp add` so the CLI validates transports, headers, and
OAuth settings exactly as it does for the web panel. Connection state comes from
`pi mcp list --json`, run on demand because it starts every enabled server.
Project files keep pi's trust rule at run time: the terminal writes them only
for the folder the person opened.

Code mode has one preference in `defaultTools` and one object in settings.
"always" appends a single `+codemode` after dropping every entry that names
codemode; "automatic" drops it and deletes the key when only modifiers would
remain, so pi's defaults are not read as "no tools". `codemode.mode` and
`codemode.inlineBudget` are edited in place, with "on" and a blank budget
deleting the key because those are pi's defaults.

Project writes are trust-gated. `internal/config/trust.go` reads pi's
`trust.json` and resolves the nearest decision, including inheritance from a
parent folder. MCP writes need an explicit decision even when the folder has no
project resources; plugin writes accept a fresh folder and require trust once
project resources exist.

Plugins are the `packages` array in `settings.json` and in the project's
`.pi/settings.json`. A string entry is enabled; an object whose four resource
lists are all empty is disabled. Disabling a filtered entry is refused because
the write would drop the filters, exactly as the web panel refuses it. Every
mutation goes through `internal/config` under the lock, so an entry keeps its
position, unknown keys (`autoload`, say) and the rest of the file. Installing,
removing, and updating shell out to `pi install/remove/update`, which writes the
same settings entry pi itself reads.

Skills are read with pi's own discovery rules: a `SKILL.md` directory is one
skill and is not recursed into, standalone `.md` children are skills, and
symlinks are followed. The roots are the agent directory's `skills/`, the
project's `.pi/skills/`, and the `skills` list in `settings.json`.
`disable-model-invocation` is edited line by line inside the frontmatter so the
rest of the file keeps its formatting, and the write follows symlinks (a global
skill installed by `npx skills` is a link into `~/.agents/skills`). Installing
and updating shell out to `npx skills`, matching the web panel's CLI, rather
than writing skill directories in Go.

Goals are the goal package's, not the client's. `internal/session` reads the
newest `custom` entry whose `customType` is `pi-better-goal` or
`pi-codex-goal`; `set` supplies the status, objective, and usage, and `clear`
retracts it. The `/goal` command opens a panel that only sends `/goal …`
prompts to the installed package, which owns continuations and completion. The
package is never bundled: availability is the `goal` command reported by
`get_commands`, and the terminal-only `goalEnabled` preference refuses to turn
on without it. `pie-tui` writes no goal state of its own, so a goal started in
Pie appears in the header here and the reverse.

Settings › Models merges three sources without a second cache:
`models-store.json` (pi's catalog), `models.json` (custom providers, models,
and model overrides), and `get_available_models` (what the running agent
actually exposes). `internal/modelcatalog` owns the merge and the minimal-edit
rules for `enabledModels`: turning one model off expands only the pattern that
covers it, preserves `:thinking` pins, and never touches patterns that match
nothing. Writes go through `internal/config`, so a provider or model added in
the terminal appears in Pie and the reverse. The context-window cap in
`pie-model-settings.json` is shared, but only Pie's server applies it to a
runtime; the terminal client cannot re-clamp pi's in-process model list.

## Startup and shutdown

1. Resolve `pi` (flag, environment, `PATH`). Missing binaries print install
   instructions and exit with code 2.
2. Start `pi --mode rpc` with the pass-through flags.
3. Handshake: `get_state`, `get_available_models`,
   `get_available_thinking_levels`, `get_commands`, `get_session_stats`, and
   `get_messages` when the session already has history.
4. Render the TUI on the alternate screen and pump events.
5. On exit: close stdin (orderly shutdown), wait 3 s, SIGTERM the process group,
   wait 2 s, then SIGKILL. The child is put in its own process group so a
   `SIGTERM` reaches subprocesses too.

If the child dies, the UI keeps the last stderr lines, shows them in an error
block, and refuses to send more commands.

## Testing strategy

- `internal/rpc/client_test.go` builds `testdata/fakepi` as a real child process
  and covers out-of-order responses, malformed lines, CRLF, 1 MiB records,
  oversized records, child crashes, request timeouts, slow consumers, graceful
  close, and SIGTERM escalation. The test binary itself is not used as the fake:
  modern Go testing captures `os.Stdout`, which delays protocol writes.
- `internal/rpc/e2e_test.go` runs against a real pi when `PI_TUI_E2E_BIN` is set.
  `PI_TUI_E2E_PROMPT=1` adds one model round trip.
- `internal/ui/*_test.go` drives the model with a fake client, so key handling,
  streaming, dialogs, and rendering are tested without a terminal.

```bash
make test
go test -race ./...
PI_TUI_E2E_BIN=$(command -v pi) go test ./internal/rpc -run TestRealPi -v
```

## Known limitations

- No image or file attachments yet; prompts are text only.
- Extension `setWidget` output is folded into the status line instead of a
  dedicated panel.
- The diff view is prefix/suffix based. It is exact for edit tools' replacement
  snippets, but a full Myers diff is not implemented.
- Built-in TUI-only pi commands (`/hotkeys`, ...) do not exist in RPC mode and
  are not offered; the client implements its own `/settings` panel.
